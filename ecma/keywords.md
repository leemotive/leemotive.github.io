The following tokens are ECMAScript keywords and may not be used as Identifiers in ECMAScript programs.


**await break case catch class const continue debugger default delete do else export extends finally for function if import in instanceof new return super switch this throw try typeof var void while with yield**

In some contexts **yield** and **await** are given the semantics of an *Identifier*. See 12.1.1. In strict mode code, **let** and **static** are treated as reserved words through static semantic restrictions rather than the lexical grammar.

**enum**

Use of the following tokens within strict mode code is also reserved. That usage is restricted using static semantic restrictions rather than the lexical grammar:
**implements package protected interface private public**
