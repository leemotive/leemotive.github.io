# ls

- 默认ls输出方向是先纵向再横向输出，个人不是很习惯，这是可以用-x选项调整

`ls -x`

- ls输出的内容比较单调，可以使用[colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)美化

- `ls -F` 可以在不同类型文件后添加一个标记
> Display a slash (`/`) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (`*`)
  after each that is executable, an at sign (`@`) after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=`)
  after each socket, a percent sign (`%`) after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|`) after
  each that is a FIFO.
