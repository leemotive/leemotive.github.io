# ECMA

- A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: **Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String**, and **Symbol**; an object is a member of the built-in type **Object**; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a method.
- ECMAScript defines a collection of built-in objects that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics of the language including **Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol**, and various **Error** objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including **Math, Number**, and **Date**; the text processing objects **String** and **RegExp**; objects that are indexed collections of values including **Array** and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including **Map** and **Set** objects; objects supporting structured data including the **JSON** object, **ArrayBuffer, SharedArrayBuffer**, and **DataView**; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and **Promise** objects; and reflection objects including **Proxy** and **Reflect**.
